# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This is a rudimentary implementation of the Classic Arcade Game Frogger.

## Instructions

The goal of the game is to move your player, square by square, from the starting position at the bottom of the screen to the top row where there is water.

To move your player, use one of the four appropriate arrow keys on your keyboard.

*Avoid the bugs*
When you collide with a bug, the bug will stop and your player will blink, indicating a collision.  After this, your player will reset to the starting position.

*Winning*
When you enter the water, your player will blink for a few seconds to indicate success, and then will be reset in the starting position. After each win, the bugs will get a little faster...
